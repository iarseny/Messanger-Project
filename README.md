It is a Learning Project for now, but in the future i maybe will be used as something more important.
Frontend is written on React js.
Backend is written on javascript(framework express js)
As the database we use postresql(with kafka)

What do you need to know to join:
1)javascript basic syntax
2)react js
3)html
4)css
5)some css technologies such as pure css, flexbox, bootstrap, tailwind(the most important to know at least flexbox)
6)sql(for backend)
7)express js(for backend too)

See you later :)
